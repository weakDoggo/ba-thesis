This thesis considers the effectiveness of regularization in the research field of graph classification and regression tasks to solve the problem of over-fitting and over-smoothing. %, which are very common problems occurring in \acfp{gnn}.
The performance of four types of regularization techniques is evaluated and shown to be ineffective on two types of \ac{gnn} network architectures \ac{gcn} and \ac{gin} across five different molecular \ac{ogb} datasets. The similarity between \ac{gdc} and \ac{de} is highlighted.
We show that the evaluated \ac{gnn} architectures are unaffected by the problem of over-smoothing on graph-level tasks, and the over-fitting aspect is shown to be unmitigated by regularization.
